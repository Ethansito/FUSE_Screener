# Concept:
# We want to create a stock screener that allows the user to sort through stocks based on criteria such as price and
# volume and allows the user to set alerts for when their chosen stocks meet certain criteria.

# This will be accomplished using the Alpha Vantage API to get stock information.
# Currently, we do not know how alerts will be handled. More research is required.
# The gui part of the program will be handled by pyautogui.
